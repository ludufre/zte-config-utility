# zte config utility

The core of the decoding work is taken from a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/GGxbngtK) dump by 'Felis-Sapien'.

Creates byte-perfect binaries for the limited number of `config.bin` that have been tested.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo and run `python3 setup.py install --user` to install the `zcu` module.
You can then use the scripts in the [resources](./resources) directory.

NOTE: This project has only been tested against **Python 3.5** and higher.

## Examples

### Decode/Encode a ZTE F660 config.bin

```sh
$ python3 examples/decode.py resources/config.bin resources/config.xml --key 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
$ python3 examples/encode.py resources/config.xml resources/config.NEW.bin --key 'xxxxxxxxxxxx' --signature 'F680' --include-header
$ md5sum resources/config.bin resources/config.NEW.bin
b6408a2ab9bd8827eb717e9ad6aeb2dd  resources/config.bin
b6408a2ab9bd8827eb717e9ad6aeb2dd  resources/config.NEW.bin
```

### Grab 'signature' from a `config.bin`

```sh
$ python3 examples/signature.py resources/config.bin
F680
```

## Limitations

The decoder has only been tested against `config.bin` files generated by the following routers:
 - `F660`
 - `F680`
 - `F6600P`

It makes a number of assumptions due to this. The encoder has not been tested in the wild. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

The AES encryption relies on [pycryptodomex](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodomex/).
